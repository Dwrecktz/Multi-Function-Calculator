# Multi-Function Calculator
This Multi-Function Calculator can be used for Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, or Division.

# How to use:
Downlod VsCode or Visual Studio. Create a new C# Console App Project. Copy and paste the Program.cs file into your project, and then change the namespace to whatever you want.

# Running:
Press F5 on your keyboard (or run), and then it will run the program. Input either 1, 2, 3, or 4 for the corresponding function you want. Then, input your first and second number and then press enter. Additionally, you can build the project to a .exe file, for easy access.

# Modification:
To change the color of the text, go to `Console.ForegroundColor = ConsoleColor.Green;` and set Green to the color you want.
